They come and go, but it's hard to say exactly when.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/a040d0159b025d23d029498d9844f81a66d7dd8a.jpg"></article>]]></description>

Or, What was I thinking with that fluffy 80s hair? And just like the questionable fashion choices of our past, some design trends are simply products of their time (and better left there).</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/94f96fcad101aa5fa4220192a6c33378328be9ba.jpg"></article>]]></description>
